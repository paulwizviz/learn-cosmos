# Tendermint

First, Tendermint and Cosmos or Cosmos SDK belongs to the same family of software tools. We won't elaborate on the differences between the tools. You can read the difference in [Tendermint & Cosmos SDK Demystified](https://medium.com/coinmonks/tendermint-cosmos-sdk-demystified-47385cf77cf6). For now, think of Tendermint as the basic building block of Cosmos. We'll discuss the features of Cosmos details in other section of this project.

Second, the term `tendermint` encompass several things, and these are:

* an open source Go based projects;
* a practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus engine - i.e. the Tendermint Core;
* a library for the creation of Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) applications.

These elements combined to help you developed replicated state machines or Layer 1 of a blockchain protocol.

## Tendermint Source Code

Tendermint's source code is located in [(https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.git](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.git).

You use the source to generate:

* an orchestration tool named `tendermint` to manage a running `tendermint core`;
* a Go based packages (or libraries) to help you build `ABCI` application;
* an `ABCI-CLI` tool to help you debug ABCI applications.

## Tendermint Core

The tendermint core is an executable process comprise of these elements:

* a pBFT consensus engine;
* a P2P networking protocol;
* an JSON RPC protocol.

### The pBFT consensus engine

The pBFT consensus engine ensures that transactions sent to a network of nodes are recorded in the right order. 

The pBFT consensus algorithm is described in [what is tendermint?](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html).

### The P2P protocol

The P2P protocol enable nodes hosting the tendermint core, is the basis for nodes to communicate with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.

### The JSON RPC protocol

The JSON RPC protocol enable client applications to communicate (i.e. send transactions) with the tendermint core.

## `ABCI` application

The ABCI application, not be confused with client applications is something you create to serve as a state machine. It is similar, but entirely, to a smart contract execution engine. The relationship between an ABCI application and tendermint core is summarised in Figure 1.

An ABCI application interact with the tendermint core either as:

1. an integrated process with tendermint core.
1. a separate process.

### ABCI application integrated with tendermint core

You build this type of application using ABCI Go package [ABCI Go package](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/v0.34.x/abci). Please refer to the [ABCI specification](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/v0.34.x/spec/abci) for more information.

### ABCI application as a separate process

In this configuration, the ABCI application runs as a separate process. The application and tendermint core communicate via sockets.
