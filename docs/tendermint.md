# Tendermint

The term `tendermint` is confusing; it refers to many things depending on your point of view. Let's unpack what that term means.

* Tendermint vs Cosmos
* Tendermint from a developer's perspective

The comparison between Tendermint vs Cosmos discussed in [Tendermint & Cosmos SDK Demystified](https://medium.com/coinmonks/tendermint-cosmos-sdk-demystified-47385cf77cf6). The subject of CosmosSDK is left for discuss later. For now, just think of CosmosSDK as a superset of Tendermint.

Fron a developer's perspective, Tendermint is:

* an open source Go based projects;
* a collecion of tools to help you develop replicated application (i.e. the basis for Layer 1 of a blockchain stack);
* an orchestrator to instantiate practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus engine;
* a library for the creation of Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI) applications.

## Tendermint source code

The project\s source code is [(https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.git](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint.git).

From the source code, you derived:

* a `ABCI-CLI` tool;
* an orchesttration tool named `tendermint` to execute an engine known as `tendermint core`;
* a series of cli tools. also known as `tendermint`, to diagnose a running `tendermint core`;
* a set of Go based packages (or libraries) to help you build `ABCI` application.

## Tendermint core

The tendermint core is an executable process comprise of these elements:

* a pBFT consensus engine;
* a P2P networking protocol;
* an JSON RPC protocol.

### The pBFT consensus engine

The pBFT consensus engine ensures that transactions sent to a network of nodes, and all nodes record the transactions in the right order. The pBFT consensus algorithm is described in [what is tendermint?](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html).

### The P2P protocol

The P2P protocol enable nodes hosting the tendermint core, is the basis for nodes to communicate with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.

### The JSON RPC protocol

The JSON RPC protocol enable client applications to communicate (i.e. send transactions) with the tendermint core.

## `ABCI` application

The ABCI application, not be confused with client applications, is an application to operate with the tendermint core (see Figure 1).

The ABCI application serves as the state machine or business logic component of a tendermint node.

There are two ways of integrating ABCI application with the tendermint core.

1. ABCI application integrated with tendermint core.
1. ABCI application as a separate process.

### ABCI application integrated with tendermint core

This solution involves the use of the ABCI Go packages. This requires you to build the solution in Go.

Please refer to the following items for reference.

* [ABCI Go package](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/v0.34.x/abci)
* [ABCI specifiction](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/v0.34.x/spec/abci)

### ABCI application as a separate process

In this configuration, the ABCI application runs as a separate process. The application and tendermint core communicate via sockets.
